### Transportation Object Detection Web Application

This repository contains a web application for performing object detection on transportation-related images, such as traffic camera images. The application allows users to upload images, detect objects in them (e.g., vehicles), and display the results.

# Setup Instructions:

This guide provides instructions for setting up, running, and testing the web application locally.

## Installation

Before running the web application, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
- **Python**: Programming language (for backend) [Download Python](https://www.python.org)
- **Docker**: Containerization platform (optional, for Docker deployment) [Download Docker](https://www.docker.com)

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
Install Node.js Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Backend Setup:

Navigate to the server directory:

bash
Copy code
cd server
Install Python Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download Pre-trained Model:

Download the pre-trained object detection model and place it in the server directory. You can use a model from TensorFlow Model Zoo or any other source.

Start the Backend Server:

From the server directory, run:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
The backend server will start running on http://localhost:5000.

Start the Frontend Development Server:

Go back to the root directory of the project:

bash
Copy code
cd ..
Start the frontend development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The frontend will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

Testing:
To test the web application locally, open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000.
Upload transportation-related images using the provided form and observe the object detection results.
Ensure that the uploaded images contain vehicles or other transportation-related objects to see meaningful results.
Test different images and verify that the object detection algorithm works as expected.

Additional Notes:

This application uses React.js for the frontend and Flask for the backend.
Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system if you want to deploy the application using Docker.
For deployment instructions, refer to the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml files provided in the repository.
For any issues or questions, please create a new GitHub issue in this repository.
